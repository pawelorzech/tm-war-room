# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

TM Hub — Torn.com faction toolkit for The Masters [TM]. Monorepo: `api/` (FastAPI) + `frontend/` (Next.js 15 + React 19 + Tailwind v4).

## Commands

```bash
# Backend tests (79 tests, async)
uv run pytest tests/ -v
uv run pytest tests/test_threat.py -v          # single file
uv run pytest tests/test_routes.py -k "enemy"  # by keyword

# Frontend build (static export = the build test, no separate test suite)
cd frontend && npm run build

# Local dev
cd frontend && npm run dev                     # Next.js dev server (port 3000)
TORN_API_KEY=xxx uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8000  # backend

# Lint
cd frontend && npm run lint
```

## Architecture

### Backend (`api/`)

FastAPI app in `api/main.py` with module-level globals (`torn_client`, `key_store`) initialized in the `lifespan` context manager. Routers are wired via module-level state injection (e.g. `chain_mod.torn_client = torn_client`), not dependency injection.

- **`api/torn_client.py`** — async Torn API v1/v2 + YATA client with in-memory TTL cache
- **`api/db/`** — SQLite via `BaseRepository` pattern (`repos/base.py`): each repo gets a fresh `sqlite3.connect()` per call, WAL mode. `KeyStore` in `db/__init__.py` is a facade over `KeyRepository` + `AnnouncementRepository`
- **`api/db/migrations/`** — numbered SQL files (`001_*.sql`..`011_*.sql`) applied automatically by `runner.py` on startup against `data/keys.db`
- **`api/routers/`** — feature routers: spy, stats, market, chain, awards, targets, loot, revives
- **`api/admin.py`** — admin panel router (JWT-based admin auth, separate from member auth)
- **`api/scheduler/`** — APScheduler 4.x background jobs (stat collection daily 4:00 UTC, spy refresh every 30min)
- **`api/threat.py`** — threat scoring: relative (stat-based via spy estimates) or absolute (personalstats ratios)

All data lives in `data/keys.db` (created at runtime, gitignored).

### Frontend (`frontend/`)

Next.js 15 with `output: "export"` (static HTML). Built output goes to `frontend/out/`, copied to `static/` in Docker.

- **`src/lib/api-client.ts`** — centralized `apiFetch` wrapper; adds `X-Player-Id` header from localStorage, handles 401 auto-logout
- **`src/hooks/`** — data-fetching hooks per domain (`useWarData`, `useEnemyData`, `useTeamData`, `useAuth`, etc.)
- **`src/components/layout/`** — `AppShell` (sidebar + content), `AuthGate` (login wall), `Sidebar`, `MobileDrawer`
- **`src/types/`** — TypeScript interfaces matching API responses

### Auth flow

1. User POSTs Torn API key → backend validates faction membership via Torn API
2. Backend stores encrypted key (Fernet) in SQLite, returns `player_id`
3. Frontend stores `player_id` in localStorage, sends as `X-Player-Id` header on all API calls
4. Three roles: `superadmin` (hardcoded ID 2362436) > `admin` (DB flag) > `member`

### Deploy

Push to `master` → GitHub Actions runs tests + build → triggers Coolify deploy → Docker build (multi-stage: Node builds frontend, Python serves everything).

- Production: `hub.tri.ovh`
- Redirects: `rw.tri.ovh` → `/team`, `train.tri.ovh` → `/training`

## Env vars

| Variable | Required | Default |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `TORN_API_KEY` | yes | — |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | yes (ephemeral if missing) | — |
| `TORNSTATS_API_KEY` | no | — |
| `FACTION_ID` | no | 11559 |
| `CACHE_TTL` | no | 60 |
| `JWT_SECRET` | no (ephemeral if missing) | — |

## Versioning

TM Hub uses semantic versioning. The source of truth is `frontend/src/data/changelog.ts`.

On each deploy with user-facing changes:
1. Bump `CURRENT_VERSION` in `frontend/src/data/changelog.ts`
2. Add a new entry at the **top** of the `CHANGELOG` array with version, date, title, and changes
3. Version rules: patch (1.0.X) = bugfix, minor (1.X.0) = new feature, major (X.0.0) = breaking change
4. Change types: `feat` = new feature, `fix` = bugfix, `improve` = enhancement to existing feature

## Workflow

After each commit:
1. Run `/simplify` to review changed code for quality and efficiency
2. Fix any issues found
3. Push to master → auto-deploys via GitHub Actions + Coolify

## MANDATORY: Post-deploy sanity check

**After EVERY deploy to production**, you MUST do a browser walkthrough of hub.tri.ovh:
1. Open the site in Playwright (use `mcp__plugin_playwright_playwright__browser_navigate`)
2. Visit at least these pages and confirm they load data (not empty, no errors):
   - `/dashboard` — check member counts are > 0
   - `/team` — check members load
   - `/chain` — check chains or recent attacks show
   - `/awards` — check honors table loads
   - `/market` — check items load
   - `/loot` — check NPCs show with levels
   - `/stocks` — check portfolio or market data
   - `/bounties` — check data loads (if empty, check API logs)
3. Check browser console for errors (use `browser_console_messages`)
4. If ANY page shows empty data or errors → debug and fix BEFORE moving on
5. Take screenshots of key pages as evidence

This is non-negotiable. Real users depend on this. No shipping broken features.

## Design philosophy

Every feature must HELP players, not just display data:
- **Explain WHY data matters** — don't just show numbers, explain what they mean for gameplay decisions
- **Show data sources** — tell users where data comes from (Torn API, TornStats, cached, estimated)
- **Teach the game** — every page should have educational content: how mechanics work, what strategies to use, links to wiki/forums for deeper learning
- **Help decisions** — highlight what action the player should take based on the data
- **Be a backup** — cache data from external services (TornStats, YATA) so players have access even when those services are down
- **Build trust** — no broken pages, no empty data without explanation, always show loading/error states clearly

When building a new feature:
1. Research the game mechanic on Torn Wiki, forums, Reddit
2. Understand WHY a player would want this data
3. Build the feature with educational context (not just raw data)
4. Add data source attribution and useful external links
5. Test with real data before deploying

## Testing notes

- Backend tests use `pytest-asyncio` with `asyncio_mode = "auto"` — all async test functions auto-detected
- `TornClient` is mocked in tests by replacing the `_http` attribute with a mock that returns canned responses
- Frontend has no test suite; `npm run build` (static export) serves as the build verification
